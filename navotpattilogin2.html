        <H1>WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSE OF EXOPLANETS </H1>
        <p>Exoplanets are planets located outside our solar system, orbiting stars other than the Sun. Since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1992, thousands have been identified using various methods like the transit method, where a planet passes in front of its star, and radial velocity, detecting wobbles in a star's movement caused by an orbiting planet. These planets vary in size, composition, and distance from their host stars, with some being similar to Earth, sparking interest in the search for potentially habitable worlds. Studying exoplanets provides insight into planetary formation and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
